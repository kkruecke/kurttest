Sankt Johannis Geheimnis
------------------------

The Soest Emmanuel web site  gives it's `history <http://emmanuelsoest.ctshost.org/node/96>`_, which includes the origin of Sankt Johannis Geheimnis or St. Johns located
a mere half mile north:

    Now, the members of St. Paul's, Soest, came from a wide variety of backgrounds from different parts of Germany and America. They also came from a wide variety of different
    religious backgrounds as well - some grew up as members of strictly Lutheran churches, some as members of rather lax and theologically aberrant Lutheran churches, and some
    even came from a Reformed background. As a result of these differences, it became increasingly difficult to maintain unity within the congregation. Finally, after several
    years of internal bickering, the congregation split into two, with the more confessional, traditional Lutherans remaining as members of St. Paul's, and the rest founding
    a new congregation, which they named St. John's. For the next fifteen years, these two congregations existed side-by-side, a mere half mile down the road from each other.
    In fact, from 1860 on, it would have been possible to watch the members of St. John's enter and leave their church from the steps of St. Paul's, and vice versa. Finally,
    in 1870, after seventeen years of separation, the two churches re-merged into one congregation, calling themselves Emmanuel. Some of the former members of St. John's were
    unhappy with this merger, however, and by 1871 had already refounded their church. St. John's finally closed their doors for good in 1907 when the remaining members joined
    Grace Lutheran Church in Fort Wayne (which has itself since closed). The old cemetery of St. John's is still in existence, directly across the highway from Emmanuel.
