Methodolgy
==========

Use many records taken together to come to a conclusion rather than looking for one silver\ |ndash|\ bullet record. Use a records that may be partially ambiguous
as a working hypothesis of what is true and then use other records to corrobate the hypothesis.

When going through primary direct ancestors, use Ancestry facts as hypotheses and use the accompanying citations to try to prove the hypothesis. Look for
primary sources--death certificate, birth certificates, marriage certificates, land deeds, etc. In the case of German ancestors in Allen County, try to use Land
Ownership records, church records, cities directories and deduced censuss dates -- using both the individual and the dates of his other family members.
