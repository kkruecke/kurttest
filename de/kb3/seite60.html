<H3>Seite 60, Amid Affluence</H3>
<H4>The number of wealthy like the number of poor is growing</H4>
<P>There is more to the story than statistics. 
</P>
<P>The rich are becoming increasingly rich, but at the same time the
number of poor is increasing. There are more and more homeless who
are not able to pay the rent in the big cities. But only there do
they have a chance of finding a odd job. 
</P>
<P>Recently the German Federation of Trade Unions judged &quot;poverty
to be on the march&quot; in wealthy Germany because of climbing
numbers of social assitance recepients. In the old federal Republic
about four million are dependant on social assitance in order to
afford the cost of living. This is one side of the coin. 
</P>
<P>The other aspect appears like this way: The workers of the Federal
repulic are among the top earners compared to other countries
[international]. A representative, for example, doesn't state this
rather the chairman of the federal trade unions. IG-Metal [IG is the
trade union's name] board of directors member Bleicher comes to the
conclusion that two thirds of the population are said to have a
relatively high living standard, assets, and they are said to have
more inheritance. And the Office of Statistics has calculated Germans
are becoming richer and richer. 
</P>
<P>Poverty and wealth, these are certainly very vague terms. For the
homeless, someone who lives in the worst backroom dwelling, is
probably already a rich man. 
</P>
<P>And the poor in the Federal Republic is a rich man if you compare
his situation with the millions in the third world who have nothing
and don't know how to quiet the hunger of their children 
</P>
