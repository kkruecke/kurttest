<H3>Übersetzung von Siete 46, Seating Arrangement, is it important
at all?</H3>
<P>The fact is (dabdi = the fact is) I spent my entire life as a
student facing the teacher. I either didn´t see my classmates at all
or only from the back. Sometime I didn't know whose back this one or
that one was. I went to a lot of trouble to hear everything the
teacher said because, if I were called on, I had to repeat what I had
heard as closely as possible. Sometimes there was a short discuession
with the teacher. This made for an interesting situation. But I
nevertheless (dabei) realized that I hadn't learned to listen to the
other student nor to understand him. Because grasping a fellow
student's comments and thinking further rarely seem necessary to me.
Indeed, in the end, what the teacher had said was the only thing that
was valid.</P>
<P>However, I found it wonderful if a teach could tell nice stories.
I then eargerly listended. But everthing that stirred my emotions
stay confined in my head, so that I just sat alone with my thoughts
if I couldn't at least tell them to my parents. To offer your own
response wasn't possible in class; in addition, what was the value of
your response? Moreover, what was important was clear and the teacher
let me know what this was.</P>
<P>Certainly I learned a lot this way. But I certainly didn't learn
to work through the class material so intensivly so that I was able
to see it from different perspectives, understand its various
applications. Although I could repeat everything, it was difficult to
defend the pros and cons, to independently hand what I had learned.
Listening and commenting on what another had said was difficult
because it was so to speak like doing gymnastics. With the upper body
and the haed I had to bend backward constantly while my lower body
was glued to the chair.</P>
<P>Today I am learning to be a teacher. And it just is noteasy to
convince someone that the seating arrangement in the class must
always suit the method of work.</P>
