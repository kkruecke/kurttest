These regular expressions will stip unnecessary thml tags from a Writer
document that contains a table of German vocabulary that was saved as .html.
It will also lowercase all html tags.

Remove all attributes of non-<p> html tags and make the tag lowercase:
:%s@<\(/\=[^Pp]\w\+\).\{-}>@<\L\1>@g

To remove non-table html tags from lines like

<p><font><font>some text</font></font></p>

do:

:%s@</\=[^/t][^>]*>@@g

The '/' is needed in the first character class. Without it '/' still matches [^t], since it is 
optional as the first character.

The perl/pcre equivalents of the above would be:

'/<(\/?[^Pp]\w+).*?>/'

and

'/<\/?[^\/t][^>]*>/'
