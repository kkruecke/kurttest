<P>The Card Game</P>
<P>Mr. Kurt says nothing. He sits there and watches the game. The
four put their cards on the table, the aces and the kings, the eights
and the tens, the red ones on the red and the black ones on the
black. Mr. Kurt is having his beer warmed. His glass sits in
chrome-plated container with hot water. From time to time he lifts it
cautiously to let the water drip off. He puts it back often without
drinking because he is watching the game.</P>
<P>Mr. Kurt has his place. No one knows since when or why. Around
five o’clock he is there, sitting at the head of the table, saying
hello when he is greeted orders his beer and is brought hot water
with it.</P>
<P>At five o’clock the others arrive, the four, and play cards; not
always the same four; on Monday, mostly younger individuals. On
Tuesday, business people. On Friday, four former schoolmates born in
1912 and on the other weekdays some other four people. Mr. Kurt
always sits at the head of the table. He drinks beer and sits until
seven o’clock. If the game is exciting he remains a quarter hour
longer. He never remains longer.</P>
<P>Others are sitting in the restaurant, but no one else comes every
day. Even the owner isn’t there every evening, and the waitress has
Friday off.</P>
<P>Mr. Kurt makes no one curious. Mr. Kurt does not arouse anyone’s
curiosity. Despite that some people have gotten to know him over the
years. On the schedule of the owner, under the 14th of July, is
written “Mr. Kurt”. This day is his birthday. He receives a free
beer. The owner can’t remember how he knows Mr. Kurt’s birthday.
One would not ask Mr. Kurt about it.</P>
<P>After the game the four throw their cards on the table, take the
chalk and total things up. The loosers pay the bill. Then they get
excited about the rules and the tactics, reproach each other about
what would have happened had the king been played later and the ten
earlier. Mr. Kurt nods now and then or shakes his head. He says
nothing.</P>
<P>If Mr. Kurt didn’t know the rules of the card game, he would see
red and black cards his entire life. But he knows cards and he knows
the game. It is likely that he knows it.</P>
<P>At Mr. Kurt’s funeral, everything about him will come out, the
cause of death, his age, his birthplace, his occupation. It will be
perhaps surprising. Later a card player will say, because it is
unavoidable, that he misses Mr. Kurt. But that is not true. The game
has quite certain rules.</P>
