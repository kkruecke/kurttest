When creating a new translation, vocabulary, etc. file, often the german characters are jumbled. This seems to occur when copying
 and pasting from Write to Vim (or another editor). The only quick solution is to copy from Vim to an existing translation file that
displays correcting, and then to rename with the desired new file name.
