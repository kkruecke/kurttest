Iterators help achieve code reuse.

We want to

1. Be ignorant of the actual structure of the data
2. Implement our algorithm without even knowing the data.

Only things we require of containers:

1. element comparison for sorting
2. element access (ie a way to iterate container)


Example

Read a menu from an array and write it to the output.

We a general algorithm that can seemlessly traverse the any container.
