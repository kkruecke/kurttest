 I suffered permanent, life-altering complications from LASIK.  I know 
of thousands of people who also had a bad outcome from LASIK.  Medical 
studies demonstrate that LASIK "side effects" are common, and that 
adverse effects are universal.  LASIK surgeons do not fully inform 
potential patients, and are engaged in a cover-up. Clinical trials that 
the FDA relied upon were tainted by dishonest investigators. </td></tr>

 I am permanently disabled as a result of Lasik.  My vision is 20/20

the procedure was successful; however, while viewing an object I see six

severe dry eyes.  Currently, I am going through a period of severe

LASIK that needs to be re-evaluated but the physicians' themselves that 
perform LASIK and provide no follow up care or responsibility to their

 I had LASIK performed in 1999. Had good vision for about a year then it
 started to decline to bad night vision, double vision, ect. Virginia 
Eye Institute, who did the procedure, had me returning every 3 months 
for 8 years for checkups and i was told that nothing was wrong. I 
finally went to a different vision specialist who says he cannot correct
 the damage done by LASIK but fitted glasses to help some. My 
prescription has to be changed every 6 months to try to gradualy get my 
vision back the best it can be. I will always have vision problems since
 I had LASIK. </td></tr>

 Like the previous posters Lynn Hamilton and James  Burke,  I am 
disabled from my chosen profession by the "temporary side effects"of 
this surgery which have lasted for years.  As a direct result of this 
surgery,  I no longer can see to drive at night and my night vision is 
obscured by huge starbursts and haloes.  I also have permanent double 
vision in one eye due to a decentered ablation.   This surgery also 
induced very painful dry eyes as well as a loss of multiple lines of 
best correctable vision.due to induced irregular astigmatism.  Despite 
all these permanent unfixable complications,  I am still considered a 
success by industry standards. </td></tr>

healthy (in every way) young professional.  I will never be that person

severe depression, and even thoughts of suicide - something I never even
 thought myself capable of thinking of.  I hope to God that this tragedy

 safe ....  The media is just as corrupted as these so-called doctors

 We have to ask ourselves "do we really need LASIK now that we have a 
new and improved non-surgical vision correction procedure called 
OrthoKeratology (Ortho-K)."  Thousands of people in this country and 
around the world are choosing Ortho-K over Lasik; and still it is not 
being heavily advertised here in the U.S.   My guess is that 98% of the 
people who are having problems with Lasik were not given the option of 
Ortho-K.   The public must know they have options.  Doctors, start 
offering this procedure to your patients.  To get 
updated/educated/training on the modern advancements of Ortho-K, visit

 LASIK should be banned because they are lying and deceptive in the most
 egregious nature stating a phony 95.4% patient happy rate, knowing that
 every eye is permanently damaged with long term known incurable 
injuries, a permanent flap which never heals and is open to infection 
for life, a loss of cells (keratocytes). Yet the physicians aren't 
telling this important fact, they only tell you the benefits to sell it.
 Their commissioned corrupt staff follows. Lastly, here's the biggest 
problem. Most/ALL LASIK Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (ASFs) are 
supposed to be following the MDR regulation, but are instead NOT 
following it. That is why they continue to lie to patients telling them 
they suffer only temporary dry eye, glare, halos, contrast issues, when 
instead they should be telling them they are permanently injured, which 
would then require them to issue a Medwatch case for the injured 
patient. They are choosing to AVOID this paper trail which would send up
 a RED FLAG to the FDA, and end their millions... </td></tr>

 private eye hospital monopolises opthalmology in our city.  This 
hospital focuses on lasik eye surgery and other lucractive surgeries, 
with heavy advertising of lasik. Patients who need urgent eye care must 
wait for months, whilst potential lasik victims get an immediate, free 
consultation. Despite the fact that this lasik center creates so many 
new dry eye cases every year, the "doctors" there know nothing about dry
 eye nor are they willing to learn.  These doctors refuse to provide me 
with even the most basic dry eye care, and because they have eliminated 
all the small opthalmologists from the city I have nowhere to go.  Even 
if I get a corneal ulcer, I am completely on my own, because a doctor at

 procedure tone, they asked if I was ready and I said no partly because I
 was afraid and partly because I wasn't 100% convinsed.  They said, 
"I'll take that as a yes". But every body I had talked to said it was 
great so I thought it was just me being afraid.  I have not been happy 
since I had lasik on both eyes in 2007.  Lots of glare, shadowed vision,
 dry eye, sore eyes from the incision that doesn't ever heal closed.  I 
paniced when I lost my glasses once and I was very near sited.  I ran to
 get lasik because of the scare and now I wish I could go back to just 
wearing my glases again.  It has caused problems with my driving and 
work. Good luck with this petition </td></tr>

eye drops, wear googles, and apply moist heat compresses twice daily

 I had LASIK surgery in 1998.  I now have problems with starbursts, 
halos, double images, etc.  These problems have continued to get worse. 
 If I could go back and undo the surgery I would.  I have had a 
difficult time coping with my vision.  I don't want others to suffer 
what I have experienced.  If nothing else, there needs to be much 
tighter FDA restrictions on LASIK.  We have laws that protect consumers 
from eating unhealthy food.  Shouldn't we have some laws that help 
protect us from the negative consequences of having our cornea's sliced 
open.  This is not a minor procedure.  I entered into it too lightly.  
Please help others avoid this mistake.  Thank you,  Bryan </td></tr>

 LASIK is the worst thing going on in the medical community and the 
doctors know it.  They are more focused on making money than anything 
else.  Not many doctors out there who want to "help" people, so watch 
your back. LASIK ruined my vision, my vision is fuzzy, my eyes are 
constantly dry, red, irritated.  LASIK makes the entire medical

they just can't help themselves because the cash is quick.  Very

 I had a bad astigmatism and the only think that would correct it was 
RPG's. I've seen a second Doctor and she said the same. About a month 
ago I lost a contact  and tried to get in to see my Doctor she was

 Six days after iLASIK with Dr. Boutrous I noticed  many floaters in my 
vision, and was diagnosed with PVD at a follow-up.  However, everyone at
 the practice denies that this is a complication of LASIK.  I have been 
given many excuses: that it's normal, age-related (I was 34) , they've 
always been there, that only notice them because I'm paying more 
attention to my vision, that the floaters will "settle down after a 
while", that I'll get used to them.  It's been 17 months and they're not
 gone.  I was never this unhappy with my pre-op nearsightedness. I would
 take back my pre-op eyes in a heartbeat, if only I could, but the 
floaters aren't treatable.  I also have some night glare.  I'm sure my 
surgeon counts me as a "success" when advertising his LASIK mill to 
prospective patients.  If the LASIK surgeons deny and dismiss the 
complications they caused for past patients, how can their future 
patients make informed decisions?  I feel my surgeon violated my trust 
and his ethical obligation to first do no harm. </td></tr>

 Lasik practitioners do not disclose all risks of lasik: dry eye PAIN, 
depression, loss of income, cost of follow up treatment (drops, glasses,
 scleral lenses), loss of contrast sensitivity, loss of ability to see 
at night. The list could go on. Who in there right mind would go through
 with the procedure if they knew what the real risks were?? Until a non

complications, Lasik needs to be stopped. Enough people have already had

 Because too many patients are suffering irreparable harm due to this 
unnecessary surgery. These are real complications--not "side effects". 
If a medication had this safety profile, the FDA would withdraw it in a 
heartbeat. Addressing the advertising is not enough. There has to be a 
full investigation by the FDA into the safety and efficacy of Lasik. In a
 large percentage of patients, it has proven neither safe not effective.
 Furthermore, those providing the safety data at present have inherent 
conflicts since they stand to lose huge profits by exposing the dangers 
of this surgery. Ditto the instrument companies involved. This requires a
 similar investigation to that done for Celebrex. It is a scourge on the
 medical profession and will go down in history as that. The USFDA can 
truly do something and must act without further delay. </td></tr>

one I had severe dry eyes and poor night vision.  I ended up having my 
right eye "enhanced" one month after the initial procedure due to not 
correcting my astigmatism enough. Today I am on Restasis for dry eyes 
and recently have gone back to glasses.  I am trying to wear contacts 
but my eyes are so dry my doctor is not sure I will be able to.  I wish I
 would have never had LASIK done. </td></tr>

 I am 35 years old, was very active and fit, and am negatively affected 
by lasik...Had a thin flap cut on my left eye and an aborted procedure. 
 They had already done my right eye. I am not elegible for more surgery 
to correct due to this complication. I am optically imbalanced for life 
which severly limits my depth preception, night driving ability, and 
basically all other daily and recreational activities (I am 20/2000 in 
that eye).  I have halos, starbursts, and floaters in the eye they did 
perform surgery on "successfully".In that eye, I have regressed to 
20/50vision in a fairly short time, suffer extreme dry eye and now have 
to wear glasses AND contacts simultaneously to have any semblence of 
normal vision.  I too wish I had not done this procedure.  BTW the 
doctor classified my surgery as a success even though they totally 
screwed up the flap cut on my left eye.  How is this possible, who is 
taking a kickback?  Come on FDA, look out for the public! </td></tr>

 I had Lasik surgery on both eyes in 1996 and 1997. Since having the 
surgery I have had extreme problems with dry eyes and night vision. In 
particular star bursts when looking at lights meeting cars. I have 
discussed this with my eye doctor over the last five years and he said 
it was cataracts. I asked to have the cataracts removed but they 
refused. They said having them removed would worsen my eyesight. I have 
had my tear ducts permanently plugged and use eye drops every day yet my
 eyes are painfully dry. During my last visit I overheard my doctor 
talking with an assistant about my eyes damaged by Lasik. When he came 
back into the room I insisted he tell me if that was what is causing my 
problems with glare and dry eyes. He said it was and put me on two 
additional medications for the eyes. I have researched this problem and 
discovered Lasik has damaged millions of patients eyes. This procedure 
should not be allowed. I'm only 62 and have 20/15 vision yet I cannot 
see at night when meeting cars or looking at lights. The results of this
 procedure are not reversable and patients, like me, would have never 
had this done if we knew this would happen to us. </td></tr>

 It ruined my life. Take a perfectly healthy and successful person and 
lie to him about how easy it is to get rid of his glasses and by 
covering up all complications and stating that there are no side 
effects. There can be no greater evil than to make commerce out of 
peoples health by risking their lives and especially all that depends on
 it i.e. their normally healthy eyes. This is the biggest fraud by the 
medical fraternity all over the world amidst many as its the most 
debilitating and it just takes the life out of otherwise normal and 
healthy people leading normal happy lives. For gods sake its peoples 
"eyes", this is not a hair transplant or a hair removal or whatever 
other cosmetic surgeries are to be able to deal with an adverse outcome.
 And if people choose to risk their eyes then they should be allowed to 
do so by the Doctors explaining to them the plethora of possible 
complications that exist and if the patient can actually cope with such 
an out come and if such a realist outcome is really worth the idea of 
"getting rid of his/her glasses". Instead people are lied to and 
butchered. What a waste of lives, nothing can be more traumatic to go 
into the op-theater trusting the doctor and knowing later that nothing 
can be done to reverse your condition no matter if you spent any amount 
of money or if upi won a law suit or if you were offered a Billion 
Dollars. Your eyes are gone forever! </td></tr>

 My sister had LASIK eye surgery a year ago, and while she has obtained 
20/20 vision, she was not informed of the long-term risks including 
possible eclasia and difficulties with any future cataract surgery by 
her surgeon. It is unethical to withhold or downplay such risks to 
prospective patients for surgery.  As someone who mainly utilizes a 
bicycle for transportation (including at night), I am nervous for my own
 safety. As LASIK remains popular, there will be an increasing 
post-LASIK drivers with impaired night vision... this affects everyone. 
LASIK is a public health disaster in the making. As a public health 
professional and current PhD student, I believe the current actual risks
 of short- and long-term complications and "side effects: of LASIK are 
much to high in both frequency and possible severity to allow for this 
ELECTIVE surgery to be a good idea. It is a conflict of interest that 
laser eye centers themselves are providing the patient with information 
and consent forms. I am certain that if prospective LASIK patients were 
properly informed of the actual risks and the possible severity of these
 complications, they would elect to NOT have the surgery done. </td></tr>

 I had Lasik surgery at a very reputable center about 5 years ago.  
Since I was already over 40 it was suggested that I have mono-vision 
done so that hopefully I wouldn't need reading glasses for a very long 
time, if ever.  I'm 49 and now need reading glasses.  I've had three 
surgeries on my left eye, one to treat a condition before I even had 
Lasik (this should probably have been a warning sign to the doctor), one
 for the initial Lasik and one to "fine tune" the eye (the dominant eye)
 afterwards.  I've had problems with severe dry eye in the left eye 
periodically and it's now becoming worse and quite frequent.  I'm also 
beginning to have some of the same symptoms, except for the "foreign 
body" sensation (which is maddening!) in my right eye.  I'm fearful of 
where my eyes will be in a few years. </td></tr>

 After hearing about the results of her surgery, I became quite excited 
about getting rid of my myopia and being able to look at my son in the 
mornings without having to wear glasses. So I went to get Lasik, with 
supposedly one of the best Lasik surgeons in Austin at the time, Stephen
 Dell. I deemed the surgery a miracle. Within minutes I had 20/10 vision
 in my left eye and 20/20 vision in my right eye. Sadly within 2 years 
of the surgery, I developed mild astigmatism. At that time Dr. Dell said
 that I was ready to get a surgical enhancement. He recommended that I 
had the surgery with “a new machine that corrected astigmatism” for an 
additional $1,000 or for free with the old machine since my initial 
surgery was guaranteed for life. I declined a second surgery because I 
wanted to use the new machine and did not have the $1,000 at that time. 
On my 3rd year after lasik, I was ready to have a 2nd surgery. however, 
when Dr. Dell did the pre-surgical test, he said, “you are no longer a 
candidate for an enhancement. The Shape of your cornea has changed, 
probably because you rub your eyes or due to hormonal changes.” He did 
not tell me 1) that the astigmatism was caused by the surgery and 2) 
that I had developed ectasia. Instead he prescribed eye drops for 
glaucoma because according to him the drops could change the shape of my
 cornea,  making me a good candidate for surgery again.  Luckily, I had a
 severe adverse reaction to the glaucoma eye drops, and urgently went to
 see one of Dr. Dell’s associate, Dr. Sargent. She was clearly put off 
by the glaucoma treatment as well as the suggestion that I could have 
Lasik again by using glaucoma eye drops, and strongly suggested that I 
forget about Lasik. I did forget about Lasik and my vision continued to 
degenerate at a slow rate. I would get a new prescription every 2 years.
 Whenever, I asked why is my vision worse than before Lasik, the Dell 
associate kept saying that it must be because I was rubbing my eyes in 
my sleep.   Not undergoing the second surgery most likely saved my 
sight,  my uncle remarked as well as Dr. Wang. Nevertheless, the process
 of Ectasia could have been delayed if I had worn appropriate contacts 
early on.  In other words, Dell Associates knew what was going on and 
didn’t diagnose me </td></tr>

 January 12, 2005. A day that I wish I can erase from my life. The day 
that will hunt me forever until my life has run it's course. This is the
 day I got "Custom Lasik" which should have been called a Custom 
Nightmare that will last a life time!! I suffer from bad GASH. I see 
dayburst, starburst, double vision, Glare, Halo's, Light sensitivity, 
loss of contrast, dry eyes, headaches, fluctuation vision. Opting to 
"throw away my glasses" has been the worst decision of my life by far. 
LASIK destroyed my promising life and career. Suicide cross my mind less
 than a year after I got LASIK. I had to learned how to beat this and 
coupe with it. I couldn't believe what was going on with my life, it 
totally took a 180 for the worst. I really can go on forever about this 
dreadful surgery but I'm not going too b/c the damage is done and cannot
 be fix. Because of LASIK, my trust in doctors are at 0 percent. I can't
 see a doctor w/o asking a thousand and one questions. So I leave you 
all with this. If you are an eye doctor I have not forgotten, my eyes 
will not allowed it. This surgery is senseless and inhumane and you all 
need to be ashamed of yourselves. You are lower than dirt, you are by 
far worst than the world maddest serial killer. You guys are the worst 
type of criminal. You may have taken my healthy eyes from me, but you

 I'm so mad!!!  I've been living with such rotten vision since 2006,, I 
was messed up day one and it just got worse.!  No ONE said it could be 
this bad!!! Swervy world, loss of contrast, ghosty line around people. 
squares aren't square, circles aren't round,, things aren't clear... and
 it costs a boatload of money to get any contact that even help. It 
doesn't fix it all, but helps,,, and I will have to worry about being 
fit for lenses for the rest of my life.! My irregular corneas cannot be 
fit with regular hard or soft lenses.. But only with contacts that 
overall cost thousand of dollars and add more cost every couple years to
 get replacements.. And The emotional trauma I went through and the 
daily PAIN I go through still (cuz you can't escape it) every day.. You 
can't heal from it, because it's right in front of you every waking 
minute.  This needs to be banned.. I've met too many others personally 
myself that have been harmed. If I am only ONE person and meeting so 
many, you know how many others are out there, besides the one on this 
petition. Not every harmed know there is a petition. And think of those 
who really NEED corneal transplants.. we can't donate our eyes, and some
 of us have to use the transplants that others could have, because now 
our eyes are so totally damaged.  I'm just soooo angry!!!! And pray that
 it is stopped!!! I am so sorry to all of you who have been through what
 I have.. So sorry!!  We need doctors to help those of us harmed , in 
finding some way to repair the damage without causing more damage..  Too
 many people are suffering! </td></tr>

 I was told would heal, but it wont), terrible night vision with 
starburst, halos and hard time seeing in darker areas and headaches.  
This has caused massive depression and anxiety and I am now in constant 
fear of having more severe eye problems.  It makes my job much much 
harder since I work on computers for 8 - 12 hours a day.  Worst mistake 
of my life by far.  I was misinformed or had the severity of issues with
 LASIK down played by the doctor.  If I had known how it really was, I 
would never have had this procedure done. </td></tr>

 A letter for help January 2007. After graduating from college, I accept
 to do LASIK myopia surgery. 1200 degrees of myopia before surgery. 
After surgery the abnormal dry eyes. A month after the surgery, my left 
eye began to be uncomfortable together. The left side of the head is not
 comfortable, that will get better over time, but did not, and it is 
more and more serious. That time the eyes eyelids feel no serious tear 
of lubrication left eye than the right eye. But not in pain, eyelid not 
broken, so that time does not particularly care about. Never know what 
is dry eye. Because dry eye phenomenon never had before surgery. The 
postoperative corneal a neurotomy perception reduce corneal did not feel
 dry and hot. But the upper and lower eyelids often becomes inflamed, 
bloodshot. Six months after surgery eyes slowly began to ache. The eyes 
are very dry eyes like a stinging pain morning, and almost earned not 
open our eyes. Even worse is very serious pain in the left eye, and 
along with the left side of a headache. The left eye often tears, and 
often pain blinded. Eyes closed, lying on the bed, his left eye is still
 very uncomfortable. Every day, there can not be normal learning and 
working. How can not get out when feeling left cornea and left eye, 
upper and lower eyelid and the left side of the head daily pain, like a 
knife bar from the eyes to the head, like a left eye eyes inside a small
 stone mill to rub off . Time every day, can not sleep, frequent 
insomnia, can not rest, eyes closed, unable to relieve pain. Sleep until
 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock every day will be the left eye pain and headache
 to wake up, and could no longer sleep. The left side of his head is 
feeling the same pain like cramps. Headache until today left eye pain 
and left the light weight, serious when there is no way to be alleviated
 only hard with the palm of your hand to press the left eye and squeeze 
the left cornea. Serious when trying to dig out the left eye to freed. 
Often feel eyes closed roll his eyeballs sometimes more than open eyes 
uncomfortable. Blink more painful than not blink. That time often check 
my eyes and the upper and lower eyelids. Because the left side of the 
lower eyelid dry eye, left eye damage and ulcers. Left eye eyelid is 
more than the right eye redness. The eyelids also very swollen. And 
headaches that may have a direct relationship. Left eye pain and 
headache then to now has not been much improvement. Until August 24, 
2011, there were some changes. Since that day I did lasik the secondary 
left eye corrective surgery. The left cornea eccentric irregular 
asymmetrical get a little bit of correction, but after surgery to 
improve pain and dry eye effect. The postoperative left eye pain and 
headache alleviate. Although left eye morphogenetic get a little 
improvement after the second surgery, left eye pain and headaches 
improved than before, but corneal shape has not been fundamentally 
changed. The problem persists - my left eye is still pain and 
accompanied by a headache, but lighter than before. 8 months after 
corneal morphology rollback. The curvature of the cornea above seems to 
increase. Schirmer coating seems to have problems, aggravate dry eyes 
and headaches. The pain remains a serious problem affecting my life - 
during the day and does not work learning, the night is not normal 
sleep. Sleep around 5:00, I will be left eye pain and headaches wake-up 
to, and can no longer sleep in pain every day. Although pain than the 
previous three or four o'clock in the morning we wake up stronger. But 
the whole body is still getting worse, the body immunity getting worse. 
From 2007 to today, my life has been unable to take care of themselves, 
have been required family members to take care of every day still does 
not sleep. Although the daily difficulties and eye pain and headaches 
affect sleep sleep, will not be able to work and learn. From 2007 to 
today, the binocular vision is very bad. Poor night vision. The 
nighttime glare very serious, was able to go out walking and driving. 
More do not know the road, at night is very difficult depending on the 
material. Now the left eye is still about 150 degrees of hyperopia and 
astigmatism of more than 150 degrees.  I I have a love of philosophy and
 art. Young people a love of life and thinking.I once wrote a 
philosophical treatise of thirty thousand words "Art, the presence of 
vitality." Has a profound insight into the human vitality. I had a dream
 to be a philosophy professor. But in January 2007, everything changed. 
The postoperative left eye pain and headaches so I have no way 
Rethinking macro-proposition of the life of the universe. Able to 
survive normal eating and sleeping is my proposition. If the instinct of
 these people need to be very difficult, then what is contributing to 
society? Everything thinking around my disease. I was seeking a variety 
of ways to just quickly put my cure. From 2007 to August 2011. Four 
years, traveled to hospitals across the country for medical treatment. 
Help many many doctors doctor. Help over including ophthalmology, sinus 
Division, Department of Neurology, Neurology, Immunology, liver and 
kidney Branch spine Branch, dental, etc.. Systemic done several checks, 
including full-body CT repeatedly, the brain CT multiple sinus CT 
several immune five checks several times, rheumatic detection times, 
blood urine test repeatedly, spinal X-rays, chest X-ray optic nerve 
detection, head of neurological tests many times and so on, without any 
problem. Even try to do the sinuses abscess surgery. Since then left eye
 pain and headache thought it was a sinus cysts cause, so do unnecessary
 surgery. No improvement at after regret. Order the cure spent nearly 
300,000 yuan of money, but still to no avail. The left eye pain on the 
left headache still not seen any improvement. Although the body has done
 repeatedly over the checks are no problem, but the eye examination 
several times to check out the dry eye and eccentric cutting. Eyes in 
each hospital to check his eyes after LASIK dry eye. Wenzhou Eye 
Hospital check: the bottom of the right cornea often punctate staining, 
the bottom of the left cornea sustained punctate, strip, sheet stained. 
The binocular eye conjunctiva nipple hyperplasia, such as conjunctiva 
small follicles. The double tear film is incomplete. The binocular basal
 tear test right eye for the 7mm, 4mm left eye. Tear film breakup time 
right eye but = 1 second left tear film breakup time but = 0 seconds; 
checks, Beijing Tongren Hospital: eyes the basal tear test right eye 
7mm, left eye 5 mmBut the left tears membrane is not complete; the 
Guangzhou Zhongshan Ophthalmic Hospital test: corneal limbus below the 
left and right side the visible large number of point-like staining FL 
(+); ENT Hospital of Fudan University, checks, experts believe that my 
left eye after LASIK surgery irregular eccentric cutting, so the cause 
of dry eye symptoms. The Professor of Beiyisanyuan think my left eye 
pain and headaches and visual fatigue. Hyperopia, astigmatism, glare can
 cause a recurring visual fatigue and headaches discomfort; doctor 
thinks double cornea after my LASIK surgery asymmetric index is high. 
Than before surgery, the cornea was more irregular asymmetric 
morphology. Partial left eye cornea center cutting can cause eye fatigue
 can also lead to severe dry eye; doctors think I corneal nerves has not
 yet returned to normal levels, they believe that the general 
postoperative year corneal nerve basic recovery, but some people need to
 longer; doctors believe excimer cutting more than 1,000 degrees of 
myopia center of the cornea is too flat, too steep surrounding. 
Reduction of central corneal curvature and increased peripheral corneal 
curvature, the tension and Pressure of the eyelids on the cornea 
concentrated in the periphery of the cornea, rather than central. So the
 eyelid  no better oppression central corneal makes central corneal 
sensitivity reduced sensitivity to reduced tear secretion. This is more 
apparent in the corneal topography of the comparison of the left-eye and
 right-eye. Combined with the left eye eccentric Consumers cut the lead 
to severe dry eye caused by tear film coating uneven. Some The doctor 
thinks my left eye corneal topography on top of curvature change too 
suddenly. Curvature of the cornea soon change from 43D to 33D. The 
transition from the short and not likely to cause the upper eyelid blink
 uneven corneal tension and tear coating uneven. Plus the central cornea
 perception lower decrease in tear secretion. The periphery of the 
cornea steep, easily eyelid to form a larger tension and friction of the
 cornea steep, easy to aggravate dry eye symptoms and headaches.     In 
short, this non-human suffering all day torment haunt me, I can not 
stand. I do not want to die relief. Do not want to put their own eye dug
 to relieve the pain. I have always felt that there is still hope. Is 
blind Well than this pain. Is replaced the cornea also did not like me 
so painful ah. At least not like me because of left eye pain and 
headache, there dry eye seriously affect sleep ah! I traveled all over 
the country to find a lot of doctors, they do not have a good way, The 
doctor will say: like me, only to find the first time you do lasik 
surgery doctor to help you solve. They would say: do the surgery in 
which hospital you go to which hospital they give you. I find many of my
 surgeon and his hospital, they did not have any way, and very 
irresponsible to tell me: My question and their operation does not 
matter。I really have nowhere to get consultation and treatment 
desperation. So request you kindly doctor to help me, I really have the 
heart of the removal of the eye. I hope that doctors consider surgery to
 help me solve the problem, including lamellar keratoplasty surgery. I 
hope to restore some of the central corneal thickness and central 
curvature doctor who can help me to save my eyes, no matter what way. If
 the surgery can be restored. Then surgery all risks and consequences to
 be borne by the patient himself, can a lawyer do notary. I hope the 
doctor who canceled the concerns and worries. Help me to improve central
 corneal morphology. Now because of eye problems, because the night 
unable to sleep, the body is getting worse, trance memory decline. My 
immune system is getting worse each organ problems, it seems there are 
problems with the body's metabolism. My wife is very good, she was 
always there for me to take care of me and help me. The more so the more
 I feel guilty. Her into trouble because of my illness. Sometimes I 
really want to walk away from the pain. But I am worried that my family 
would feel sorry for me. Worried about my wife alone and helpless. The 
family always encouraged me to let me brave and strong in the face of 
difficult! I remind myself all the time my illness is getting better. 
But again and again the active treatment and in exchange fail again and 
again. Again and again to seek medical treatment, but in exchange for a 
second doctor who cold-shoulder treatment. I hope to win and beliefs do 
not know how long it can hold?  My sister has also done a lasik surgery 
for myopia. We do the surgery in a hospital.600 degrees of myopia before
 her surgery.After her surgery and some dry eye syndrome.But after six 
months to disappear soon improved.My cousin did the lasik surgery for 
myopia, myopia 500 degrees before surgery.The basic symptoms of dry eye 
after surgery.Many of my friends also done lasik myopia Surgery.Their 
pre-operative are basically 500-600 degrees of myopia, 100-200 degrees 
of astigmatism.Within one year after surgery, dry eye symptoms have 
disappeared.I was the only the highest myopia, up to 1100 
degrees.Postoperative only my dry eye has not improved.And getting 
worse.   .From 2007 to today, the past five years, I have used countless
 ways to the treatment of left eye pain headache and dryeye. The 
doctor's advice with lot many ways no better but to no avail. Over the 
past five years including the use of a variety of artificial tears. 
Including imports of preservative-free artificial tears. Ten minutes 
with artificial tears. For example the Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium Eye
 Drops times contingent, Dextran70Eye Drop, Refresh, URSAPHARTM Arzne 
Hycosan bought countless but the effect is minimal. Has been used the 
lacrimal embolism - including tears of the Smart Plug and tear duct 
plugs used many times and no improvement. There are contact lenses, with
 the the the zero mirror and RGP protect the cornea Medical, the result 
is more wear worse, can not be tolerated. Has always insisted on using 
eyedrops - including a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs and surrounded
 neomycin improved, used hundreds of anti-inflammatory drugs, but with 
much more dry eyes. Oral medications - with Chinese medicine including 
western medicine to stimulate tear secretion and Yin and enrich blood 
effect. Only slightly ease the symptoms of dry eye, but not of much help
 to alleviate the left eye pain. Moreover, long-term medication appears 
significant side effects, and a threat to other organs. Eat traditional 
Chinese medicine has been insisting for nearly two years. Dry eye pain, 
but can not solve the problem. Health care products - always insisted on
 eating a variety of vitamins and lutein, as if no effect. Adhere eaten 
for some time, analgesic drugs and psychotropic drugs - including 
various antidepressant anxiolytics and Western medicine and traditional 
Chinese medicine to promote sleep, in addition to the brain 
unresponsive, eye pain and therefore alleviate. Contrary eat these drugs
 more dry eyes. The treatment of dry eye include Chinese acupuncture and
 fumigation by grinding and eye - including eye acupuncture and body 
acupuncture conditioning, but no substantial improvement in the left eye
 pain and headache problems. However, I seem to comfort. Also include a 
variety of physical therapy, the left eye ocular anti-inflammatory 
therapy, the effect is very short-lived. The above method can not 
improve pain problems. The left eye pain and left headache and still can
 not be mitigated. Serious still use the palm of your hand to press the 
cornea and the eye to relieve the pain and headache. Submandibular gland
 transplant ever wanted to do to ease the most frustrating case. It is a
 major surgery, the mouth is very dry after transplantation. Doctors do 
not recommend that I do so, because of the lacrimal gland and tear 
secretion is good. They think my problem is that the shape of the 
cornea. The fact that, as they say：my question exactly corneal shape.  
On August 24, 2011, I do left eye secondary lasik surgery. It is guided 
treatment of hyperopia and astigmatism, corneal topography (T-CAT) LASIK
 surgery. Corneal shape after only a little change, but it was to 
improve left eye pain and headaches as well as to improve the effect of 
dry eye is very obvious. Sleep also improved a lot. Later, I proposed to
 the doctor again lasik surgery. Vision, I do not consider. 1200 degrees
 of myopia even back to 2007 years ago, I was very happy. I am also very
 pleased to wear thick glasses. The key is to corneal shape. But the 
doctor said I corneal thickness has few remaining. In this case, I think
 a to do corneal stroma microlens filled surgical implantation. 
Femtosecond lenticule re-implantation transplant a lenticule.  Is to cut
 the corneal supplemented back. Although it is not possible to 
completely do as morphology before lasik surgery back in 2007. But I 
think if you restore some form of increased central corneal curvature 
can be a good solution to my problem. To correct a little eccentric 
cutting. Lamellar transplantation the corneal technology has been very 
mature, allograft the corneal rejection probability is very low, not to 
mention micron calculate the thickness of the cornea corneal microlens. I
 want to fill my original corneal flap corneal microlens to improve my 
cornea forms a 600-800 degrees. As before people do 500-600 degrees of 
myopia lasik surgery, very few people will have to dry eye, corneal 
topography and central corneal curvature and has not changed much. 
Problem will do lasik surgery myopia above 1000 degrees. As the doctor 
said central corneal curvature is too low causes the eyelid tension and 
pressure is concentrated in the periphery of the cornea, rather than 
central. Restore central corneal curvature to reduce peripheral 
curvature fundamental improvements in tear distribution. If filling 
ineffective also can take down. If you fill really solve my problem 
until it becomes better and better, then my life is no longer a tragedy!
 Future and hope no longer slim! Moreover, this method can help more 
people who need help!  一封求救信 
2007年1月。大学毕业后，我接受做LASIK近视手术。手术前1200度近视。手术后双眼干燥异常。手术后一个月，我的左眼开始难受起来。左边头部也
不舒服，以为过段时间就会好，可是没有，而且是越来越严重。那个时候双眼眼睑感觉无泪液润滑左眼比右眼严重。但并不是很疼，眼睑也没有破损，所以那时候没
有特别在意。以前从不知道什么是干眼症。因为在手术前从来没有过干眼现象。术后角膜神经切断知觉降低角膜没有感到干燥和炙热。但是上下眼睑经常充满血丝变
得红肿。手术后半年双眼开始慢慢疼痛起来。当时眼睛非常干躁，早晨起床时双眼如针刺般疼痛，几乎挣不开眼睛。更为要命的是左眼疼痛非常严重，并且伴随着左
侧头疼。左眼经常流泪，时常疼得睁不开眼睛。闭着眼躺在床上左眼依然非常难受。每天如此，根本无法正常学习和工作。那时候感觉左眼角膜和左眼上下眼睑和左
边头部每天疼痛难忍，像有刀子从眼睛扎到脑袋里，又像左眼眼睛里进去了小石头磨来磨去怎么也出不来。那时候每天都无法安睡，经常失眠，无法休息，闭眼也无
法缓解疼痛。每天睡到凌晨3点到4点钟就会被左眼疼痛和头疼的叫醒来，再也无法安睡。左边脑袋感觉像抽筋一样疼痛难忍。直到今天左眼疼痛和左边头疼时轻时
重，严重时毫无办法，只能用手掌使劲按压左眼球和挤压左角膜加以缓解。严重时想把左眼球挖出来得以解脱。时常感觉到闭着眼转动眼球有时比睁着眼更难受。眨
眼比不眨眼更痛苦。那个时候经常检查我双眼的上下眼睑。因为干眼，左眼下眼睑的左边有破损和溃疡。左眼上眼睑比右眼则更加红肿。眼皮也很肿胀。那可能和头
疼有直接关系。左眼疼痛和头疼从那时到现在一直没有多少好转。直到2011年8月24日有一些改变。因为那天我做了lasik二次左眼矫正手术。左眼角膜
偏心不规则不对称得到一点点的矫正，但术后改善疼痛和干眼症效果明显。术后左眼疼痛和头疼减轻一些。虽然二次手术后左眼形态得到一点改善，左眼疼痛和头疼
虽然比以前好转一些，但角膜形态并没有得到根本改变。问题依然存在——现在我的左眼仍然疼痛并伴随着头疼，只是比以前轻一些。10个月后角膜形态回退。角
膜上方曲率似乎增加一些。泪液分泌涂布似乎又出现问题，干眼和头疼加重。疼痛问题依然严重影响我的生活——白天无法正常工作学习，夜晚无法正常睡眠。每天
睡眠到凌晨5点左右我就会被左眼疼痛和头疼叫醒来，再也无法安睡，痛苦不堪。虽然比之前凌晨三四点钟疼醒来要强些。但整个身体还是越来越差，身体免疫力也
越来越差。从2007年到今天，我的生活一直无法自理，一直需家人照顾，每天仍然无法正常睡眠。虽然每天很困顿，但眼睛疼和头疼影响的就是睡不好觉，更无
法工作和学习。从2007年到今天，双眼视力也非常不好。夜晚的视力很差。夜间眩光非常严重。无法外出行走和开车。看不清楚路。夜晚视物非常困难。现在左
眼仍有有150度左右的远视和150多度的散光。 
我曾经是一个热爱哲学与艺术。一个热爱生命与思考的青年。我曾写过三万字哲学论文《艺术、存在、生命力》。对人类生命力有着深刻洞悉的人。我曾梦想做一名
哲学教授。但是一切都在2007年1月份被改变了。术后的左眼疼痛和头疼使我无从再思考生命宇宙之类的宏观命题了。能够正常的生存吃饭睡觉才是我最大的命
题。如果实现这些人的本能需要都很困难，那么何谈奉献社会呢？所有的一切思考都围绕着我的疾病而展开。我那时寻求着各种办法只想着赶紧把我的病治好。从
2007年到2011年8月。四年来，为了治病跑遍了全国各地医院。求助过很多很多医生大夫。求助过包括眼科，鼻窦科，神经科，脑科，免疫科、肝肾科，脊
椎骨科，牙科等等。全身做过多次检查，包括全身CT多次，脑CT多次，鼻窦CT多次，免疫五项检查多次，风湿性检测多次，血液尿液检查多次，脊椎X光，胸
部X光，视神经检测，头部神经检查多次等等，都没有任何问题。甚至为此还做了鼻窦脓肿手术。因为当时左眼疼痛和头疼以为是鼻窦囊肿造成，所以做了不必要的
手术。可术后没有一点好转很后悔。为了治病花了将近30万元钱，但依然徒劳无功。左眼疼痛左边头疼仍然未见任何好转。虽然全身多次做过各项检查都无问题，
但是眼部检查却多次检查出干眼症和偏心切削。眼睛在各医院检查为双眼LASIK术后干眼症。温州眼视光医院检查为：右眼角膜下方经常点状染色，左眼角膜下
方持续点状，条状，片状染色。双眼眼睑结膜乳头增生，结膜小滤泡等。双眼泪膜不完整。双眼基础泪液测试右眼为7mm，左眼为4mm。但泪膜破裂时间右眼
but=1秒，左眼泪膜破裂时间but=0秒；北京同仁医院检查为：双眼基础泪液测试右眼为7mm，左眼为5mm, 
但左眼泪膜不完整；广州中山眼科医院测试为：左右侧角膜下方巩缘可见大量点状染色FL(+)；复旦大学五官科医院检查后专家认为我的左眼LASIK手术后
有不规则和偏中心切削。所以造成干眼不适症状。北医三院教授认为我左眼疼痛和头疼与视疲劳有关。远视、散光、眩光可以导致经常性视疲劳和头疼不适；还有医
生认为我LASIK手术后双眼角膜非对称指数偏高。角膜比术前呈更多不规则不对称形态。左眼偏角膜中心切削可以造成视力疲劳也可以导致严重干眼；还还有医
生认为我的角膜神经还没有恢复到正常水平，他们认为一般患者术后一年角膜神经基本恢复，但有些人需要更长时间；有医生认为1000度近视以上准分子切削使
角膜中央过于平坦周边过于陡峭。中央角膜曲率的降低和周边角膜曲率的增高。使眼睑对角膜的张力和压迫力集中在角膜周边而不是中央。所以眼睑无法更好的压迫
角膜中央，使得中央角膜知觉敏感度降低泪液分泌减少。这在左眼和右眼的角膜地形图比较中更加明显。加之左眼偏中心切消，造成泪膜涂布的不均匀导致严重干眼
症。有医生认为我的左眼角膜地形图上边曲率变化过于突然。角膜曲率从43D很快转变到33D。距离短没有过渡，容易造成上眼睑瞬目对角膜张力的不均衡和泪
液涂布的不均衡。加上角膜中央知觉降低泪液分泌减少。角膜周边陡峭处容易与眼睑形成较大张力和摩擦，容易加重干眼和头疼等不适症状。 
总之，这种非人类的痛苦整天折磨着我纠缠着我，使我无法忍受。我不想以死解脱。也不想把自己眼球挖出来来缓解疼痛。我一直觉得的还有希望。就是眼睛瞎了也
要比这种痛苦好啊。就是换过角膜的人也没有像我这样这样痛苦啊。至少不会像我一样因为左眼疼痛和头疼还有干眼严重影响睡眠啊！我跑遍全国找过很多医生，他
们也没有好办法，对我这种情况束手无策。医生会说：像我这种情况只有找第一次给你做lasik手术的大夫来帮你解决。他们会说：在哪家医院做的手术你去找
哪家医院，让他们给你负责。可我多次找到我的手术医生和他所在的医院，他们也没有任何办法，并且很不负责任的告诉我：我的问题和他们手术没有任何关系。我
现在真的是求医无门走投无路了。所以请求各位好心大夫们帮帮我，我真的是摘除眼球的心都有。希望大夫们能考虑各种手术来帮助我解决问题，包括板层角膜移植
手术。希望大夫们能帮我恢复一些角膜中央厚度和中央曲率来挽救我的眼睛，不管用什么办法。如果手术能恢复。那么手术一切风险和后果由病人自己承担，可以找
律师做公证。希望大夫们取消顾虑和担心。帮助我改善角膜中央形态。现在的我因为眼睛问题，因为每晚无法安睡，身体越来越差，精神恍惚记忆力下降。我的免疫
力越来越差，各个脏器也开始出现问题，似乎全身的新陈代谢都出现问题。我的家人为我操碎了心。我的妻子非常善良，她始终不渝的陪在我身边照顾着我帮助着
我。她越是这样我就越感到愧疚。因为我的病连累了她。有时我真想自己一走了之远离痛苦。但我担心我的家人会为我难过。担心我的妻子会孤独无助。家人总是鼓
励我让我勇敢坚强的面对困难！我每时每刻都在提醒自己我的病会好转起来。可是一次次的积极治疗然后换回一次次的失败。一次次的求医问药却换回一次次医生们
的冷漠对待。我那必胜的希望和信念不知还能坚持多久？ 
我的姐姐同样做了lasik近视手术。我们在一个医院做的手术。她手术前是600度近视。她手术后也有些干眼症。但是6个月后很快消失好转。我的表哥也做
过lasik近视手术。手术前500度近视。手术后基本没有干眼症状。我的很多朋友也做过lasik近视手术。他们手术前基本都是500到600度近
视，100到200度的散光。手术后一年内干眼症状都消失了。只有我的近视度数最高，达到1100度。术后只有我的干眼症一直没有好转。而且越来越糟糕。
从2007年到今天，五年来我曾用过无数种方法治疗左眼疼痛头疼和干眼。在大夫的建议下用了很多很多很多方法却无济于事没有任何好转。五年来包括使用了各
种人工泪液。包括进口的不含防腐剂的人工泪液。十分钟用一次的人工泪液。例如潇莱威，倍然，瑞星，海露等等买过不计其数但效果微乎其微。一直用泪道栓塞
——包括泪点塞和泪道塞用过多次也无任何改善。还有隐形眼镜，用了保护角膜医用型零度镜和RGP，结果是越戴越糟，无法耐受。一直坚持用眼药——包括各种
消炎药和环抱霉素都无好转，用过上百种消炎药可是用多了眼睛更加干燥。口服药物——用了包括刺激泪液分泌的西药和滋阴补肝血的中药等也无效果。只能是轻微
缓解干眼症状，但对缓解左眼疼痛帮助不大。况且长期吃药会出现很大副作用，威胁到其他器官。一直坚持吃中药将近2年。但无法解决干眼疼痛问题。保健品——
一直坚持吃各种维生素和叶黄素，好像无任何效果。坚持吃过一段时间的止痛的药物和精神类药物——包括各种抗抑郁抗焦虑药和促进睡眠的西药和中药等，除了脑
子反应迟钝，但眼部疼痛并没有因此减轻。相反吃了这类药后眼睛更加干燥。治疗干眼还包括中医针灸和按磨和眼部的熏蒸等——包括眼部针灸和全身针灸调理，但
都无实质性改善左眼疼痛和头疼问题。似乎只是心里上的安慰。还包括各种物理疗法，对左眼眼部消炎疗法，效果很短暂。以上方法均无法改善疼痛问题。左眼疼痛
和左边头疼依旧无法缓解。严重时依然要用手掌按压角膜和眼球来缓解疼痛和头疼。在最无奈的情况下曾经想过做颌下腺移植手术来缓解。那是个大手术，移植后嘴
巴会很干。可医生并不建议我这样做，因为我的泪腺和泪液分泌是好的。他们认为我的问题是角膜形态的问题和泪腺和泪液分泌无关。后来事实证明正如他们所说，
我的问题正是角膜形态问题。 
在2011年8月24日，我做了左眼二次lasik手术。那是个治疗远视和散光的角膜地形图引导的(T-CAT)LASIK手术。术后角膜形态虽然只有一
点改变，偏心得到一点纠正。但当时改善左眼疼痛和头疼还有改善干眼效果却非常明显。连睡眠也改善很多。后来我向医生提出再次lasik手术。视力我都不考
虑。即便回到2007年前的1200度近视我非常乐意。即使戴上厚厚的眼镜我也非常高兴。关键是角膜形态。但医生说我角膜厚度已经剩余不多了。在这种情况
下，我想到了做角膜基质微透镜植入填充手术。就是把切掉的角膜再补回来。虽然不可能完全回到2007年做lasik手术之前那样形态。但我想只要恢复一点
形态，纠正一点偏心切削，增加一些角膜中央曲率都可以很好的解决我的问题。并且板层移植角膜技术已经很成熟，异体角膜排斥几率非常低，更何况微米计算厚的
角膜角膜微透镜呢。我想在我原来的角膜瓣下填充一个600到800度左右的角膜微透镜来改善我的角膜形态。正如以前人们做500至600度近视的
lasik手术后很少有人会得干眼，因为角膜形态和角膜中央曲率并没有太大改变。而近视在1000度以上的人做lasik手术后问题就会很多。正如医生所
说角膜中央曲率太低会使眼睑张力和压力集中在角膜周边而不是中央。恢复角膜中央曲率降低周边曲率会根本改善泪液分布情况。如果填充效果不好的话还可以取
掉。如果填充后真能完全解决我的问题直至变得越来越好，那么我的人生就不再是一个悲剧！未来和希望也不再渺茫！而且用这个方法还能帮助更多需要帮助的人！

 I had laser eye surgery exactly 6 years ago. I was told by the surgery 
“I was an excellent candidate” and “could expect an excellent outcome”. I
 queried the fact I had large pupils and dry eyes as I was concerned 
this could impact on the outcome, and they said it was nothing to worry 
about and wouldn’t affect the outcome. I foolishly believed them and 
proceeded with the surgery. I’ve been suffering with severe dry eye ever
 since and I’m left with permanent horrific night aberrations. Like a 
lot of people my eyesight also fluctuates greatly from day to day – a 
side effect that is yet to be taken more seriously. I receive very 
little sympathy from the surgery and at times they’ve been very 
reluctant to help. Do not believe a word these surgeons tell you – at 
the end of the day it’s a business, they’re there to make money, and 
they don’t care what the consequences will be for you! It needs to be 
banned...NOW!!! </td></tr>

 Was thinking of doing LASIK by one of the best doctor and Eye hospital 
in India.Have a presciption of about -5 in both eyes along with axis and
 cylinder.Hated glasses throughout my life and wanted to get rid of 
it,thinking I would be a more successful person without glasses.The 
doctor sounded genuine and all the tests positive in order to do the 
surgery.It surgery sounded TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE..visited another doc and 
he too told me to go ahead and let him know my condition after 2 
months..Internet has saved my life coz that's how I found about the long
 term adverse after effects of this procedure,the maintence costs seems 
life long ..Thank you all 4 saving me with your real life opinions and 
my sincerest sympathies for all those suffering today !!! </td></tr>

 I totally support this cause of banning Lasik. I have lost most of my 
vision after a failed lasik done at Visual aids center in delhi. Since 
then I have spent tons over doctors and lenses but nothing has helped.  
Surgeons are not sure why the outcome of the Lasik was a disaster while 
others say that my measurements were taken incorrectly during the 
procedure.  Lasik has ruined my professional, personal and social life. I
 can hardly see at night(and day) and might never be able to drive/ride 
again in my life. Would take legal/criminal action if this does not get 
better.  Would advice people to boycott Lasik unless you hate your 
eyesight. </td></tr>

 The surgeon never told me he created a button hole when creating the 
flap. Instead of waiting like a professional would he continued on with 
the LASIK. When he was done he said well I never had that happen before 
never told me what had happened. Fast forward years later going to a dr 
for severe dry eyes I'm finally told I have a button hole. I have 
scarring built up and now my vision has changed that am blind in that 
eye. I now have to have surgery to see if they can remove the scarring 
if that doesn't work I will be in line to have a cornea transplant. 
Don't have LASIK wear glasses or contacts. </td></tr>

 I was a bit moved when my friend who had just undergone LASIK operation
 a few days ago. She told me that the staff in the clinic told her only 
0.1% of patients need enhancement surgery after LASIK. But, luckily I 
decided to surf the net to rsearch more about the side effects, and 
gosh, for every common complications (e.g. dry eyes, cataracts) it is 
almost around 20% of the patients will suffer from it, which is, 1 in 5 
patients! 1 in 5! this is not "rare". Thanks to those who bravely posted
 out their conditions and reveal the truth behind LASIk, I have decided 
not to risk my eyes and am contented with my specs and contact lenses. 
We need to bring this awareness to more people as this surgery is 
irreversible. </td></tr>
